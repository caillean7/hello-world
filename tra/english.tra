@0 = ~Ranger / Thief Multiclass for GemRB 1.0~
@1 = ~Ranger / Thief~
@2 = ~Ranger / Thief:
Combining the Ranger's devotion to nature with the resourcefulness and affinity for mechanical devices of the thief,
the Ranger / Thief  excels in stealth and survival. While prefering any natural environment over urban settings, they can easily adapt to both. There are no racial restrictions for Ranger / Thiefs, but they must be of Neutral or Chaothic Good alignment. This is a multiclass-only combination, no dualclassing possible.~
@3 = ~RANGER/THIEF~
